### What do computing services offer?

- Compute power
    - Virtual Machine (VM): includes an operating system and hardware that appears to the user 
        like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. 
    - Containers: provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for applications, e.g. Docker
    - Serverless computing: lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. 
        You only pay for the processing time used by each function as it executes.
- Storage: auto-scalable, flexible and cost-efficient
- Networking
- Analytics

### What are the benefits of cloud computing?
1. cost-effective: pay-as-you-go / consumption-based pricing model
2. scalable:
    - Vertical：also known as "scaling up", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server
    - Horizontal：also known as "scaling out", is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit.
    
3. elastic: automatically adding or removing resources
4. current: ensures that you're using the latest and greatest tools and 
    the computer hardware is maintained and upgraded by the cloud provider.
5. reliable: providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services.  
    fault tolerance: redundancy is often built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place.
6. global: fully redundant data centers located in various regions all over the globe.   
7. secure: cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technical skills that 
    can provide better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve. 
    physical security and digital security

### CapEx Vs. OpEx

- Capital Expenditure (CapEx): 
CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. 
CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.

- Operational Expenditure (OpEx): 
OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. 
You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. 
You pay for a service or product as you use it.

### Three deployment methods of cloud computing
1. Public cloud
2. Private cloud
3. Hybrid cloud

### Three categories of cloud computing
1. IaaS: Infrastructure as a service is the most flexible category of cloud services. 
    It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application 
    (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems). 
    It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet, a shared responsibility model.

2. PaaS: Platform as a service provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. 
    For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, 
    or even system updates.

3. SaaS: Server as a service is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer.
