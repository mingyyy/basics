All Interview Questions
-----------------------

The interview questions are roughly structured like the sections in the
\"Basic data engineering skills\" part. This makes it easier to navigate
this document. I still need to sort them accordingly.

### SQL DBs

-   What are windowing functions?

According to PostgreSQL v.9 documentation, an SQL Window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row, in a way similar to aggregate functions.
A window function call always contains an OVER clause.

-   What is a stored procedure?

-   Why would you use them?

-   What are atomic attributes?

-   Explain ACID props of a database

*Atomicity* means that either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesnâ€™t happen at all. There is no midway i.e. transactions do not occur partially. 
Each transaction is considered as one unit and either runs to completion or is not executed at all. It involves following two operations.

*Consistency* means that integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction. It refers to correctness of a database. 

*Isolation* ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to inconsistency of database state. 
Transactions occur independently without interference. 
Changes occurring in a particular transaction will not be visible to any other transaction until that particular change in that transaction is written to memory or has been committed. 
This property ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently will result in a state that is equivalent to a state achieved these were executed serially in some order.

*Durability* ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if system failure occurs. 
These updates now become permanent and are stored in a non-volatile memory. The effects of the transaction, thus, are never lost.

-   How to optimize queries?

-   What are the different types of JOIN (CROSS, INNER, OUTER)?

-   What is the difference between Clustered Index and Non-Clustered
    Index - with examples?
    
*Clustered Index*

Only one per table
Faster to read than non clustered as data is physically stored in index order

In an RDBMS, usually, the primary key allows you to create a clustered index based on that specific column.
 
*Non Clustered Index*

Can be used many times per table
Quicker for insert and update operations than a clustered index
Both types of index will improve performance when select data with fields that use the index but will slow down update and insert operations.

Because of the slower insert and update clustered indexes should be set on a field that is normally incremental ie Id or Timestamp.
