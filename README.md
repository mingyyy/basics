## Data Structures
1. Array and List

2. Linked list

3. Stack and Queue
    - Stack follows first in last out (FILO) rule; e.g. stacking plates
    - Queues follows first in first out (FIFO) rule; e.g. waiting in line

4. Tree and Graph
    - tree vs. binary tree
    - complete tree vs. full tree vs. perfect tree
    - balanced vs. unbalanced
    - binary tree vs. binary search tree
    - tree traversal: preorder, inorder, postorder
    - binary heaps (min/max)
    - trie (prefix tree)
    - adjacent list vs. adjacent matrix (list of lists)
    - breath first search vs. depth first search vs. bidirectional search
    
5. Recursion & Dynamic programming
    - Top-Down Dynamic Programming (or Memoization)


6. Sorting
    - Bubble sort
    - Insert sort (start from 1 and compare with left, insert item 1 to the right place; move down to item 2 do the same until the end)
    - Selection sort(start from 0 and moving down find the lowest, swap with 0. move to 1, moving down again and swap with the lowest...)
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort(pivot and swap)
    - Bucket sort(extra space, into buckets based on number, then sort the list using insert )
    - Counting sort(extra space, for small range of numbers)
    - Radix sort(from first digit to last, using counting sort)
    - External sort
    - Tim sort
    - Heap sort
