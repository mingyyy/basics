## Data Structures
1. Array and List

2. Linked list

3. Stack and Queue
    - Stack follows first in last out (FILO) rule; e.g. stacking plates
    - Queues follows first in first out (FIFO) rule; e.g. waiting in line

4. Tree and Graph
    - tree vs. binary tree
    - complete tree vs. full tree vs. perfect tree
    - balanced vs. unbalanced
    - binary tree vs. binary search tree
    - tree traversal: preorder, inorder, postorder
    - binary heaps (min/max)
    - trie (prefix tree)
    - adjacent list vs. adjacent matrix (list of lists)
    - breath first search vs. depth first search vs. bidirectional search
    
5. Recursion & Dynamic programming
    - Top-Down Dynamic Programming (or Memoization)
